Title: Media

Media can only be added via the [item](../content/items.md). However, once an item is added, you can access individual media via the Media tab on the left hand navigation on the admin dashboard in order to edit media metadata, set the visibility of individual media, and delete media.

On the admin/media page, all media in the install is displayed in a table with the *Title*, the *Item* with which the media is associated, and the *Owner* of the media. You can sort by any of these categories using the up-down arrows in the header of the table.

Clicking on a media title will take you to the page for that media. This page displays any uploaded files as well as all metadata which has been entered or automatically generated for the media.

Clicking on the item associated with the media will take you to that itemâ€™s show page. Clicking on the owner will take you to their user information page.

## Edit Media
To edit an existing media, either click on the *edit* (pencil) button or click the media title and then select the *Edit media* button in the upper right corner of the page. 

If desired, you can select a *Resource Template* or *Class* from the two dropdown menus which load automatically. Selecting a resource template will populate the page with predetermined properties.

You can also add properties by selecting from the list on the right side of the screen. You can either browse fields by vocabulary (Dublin Core, Bibliographic Ontology, etc), or search in the *filter properties* bar above the list of properties and vocabularies.

Automatically generated metadata, such as source, visibility, and part of item, cannot be edited. 

Use the *make public/private* button (eye icon) to set whether the media is visible to the public or only to users of the OmekaS install. 

![make public button showing an eye icon](../content/contentfiles/item_public.png) Public 

![make private button showing an eye icon with a diagonal slash through it](../content/contentfiles/item_private.png)  Private

Note that if an item is private, all the media attached is private, but an item which is public can have attached media which are set to be either public or private.

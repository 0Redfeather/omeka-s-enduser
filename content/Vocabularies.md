Vocabularies are a collection of published RDF metadata Classes and Properties for describing a Resource. These exist and are created externally to Omeka, and can be imported (with some limitations) into Omeka S for use throughout the Installation. The most-used Vocabulary is Dublin Core Terms (dcterms:).

Global and Site Administrators can manage their installationâ€™s vocabularies from the *Vocabularies* tab on the left hand navigation of the Admin Dashboard. OmekaS comes pre-loaded with the following vocabularies: [Dublin Core](http://purl.org/dc/terms/); [Dublin Core Type](http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/); [Bibliographic Ontology](http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/); and [Friend of a Friend](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/). 

# Managing vocabularies
The main view of the *vocabularies* tab in the Admin Dashboard displays the existing vocabularies for the Omeka S install.

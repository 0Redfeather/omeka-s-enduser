Item Sets are an aggregation of Items. Items can belong to any number of Item Sets.

Item sets are managed via the *item sets* tab located in the left hand navigation of the admin dashboard. When on the item-set view, there is a table of all item sets with their Title, number of Items, the Owner of the set, and icons for each row representing options to *edit* (pencil), *delete* (trash can), or *view details* (ellipses). In the upper right hand corner are buttons to *Add new item set* or *Search item sets* using a detailed search form. To return to the item sets table from this search form, simply use your browser’s back button.

To view an item set, click on its name. On the item sets view page, there are tabs to see its metadata and linked resources - note that these are linked resources for the set’s metadata, not resources within the set. 

To view the items in a set, either click on the number of items in the set on the item-set view page, or click the *view items* button in the upper right corner of the individual item set page.

## Creating an item set
Item sets can draw on the same resource templates as items to populate elements from vocabularies in the OmekaS install. Item sets should have at least one element by which to identify and describe the set. 

To create a new item set, start at the item sets tab from the left hand navigation of the global admin dashboard. Click the *add new item set* button on the right hand side of the screen.

## Settings
Item sets have two settings which control their access. They can be *public* or *not public* and they can be *open* or *closed*.

An item set’s status as *closed* or *open* is toggled using the lock icon in the upper right corner of the edit view, near the *delete* and *save* buttons. When an item set is closed, only the item set creator, site admins, and global admins can edit and add items to that set. Open item sets can be edited and contributed to by any user on the install.

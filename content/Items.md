Items are the building blocks of the Omeka system. They can be images, texts, objects, or many other item types. Before creating items you may want to create [Resource Templates](/ResourceTemplate/), which will load specific fields for various item types which you define.

You can browse the items in your OmekaS install from the Items tab on the left-hand navigation of the main administrative dashboard. Each item appears as a row, with the *Title*, buttons for *edit*, *delete*, and *view info*, the *Class*, and *Date Created*. The list of items can be sorted by any of the fields listed using the up/down arrow icons at the end of that section.

## Adding an Item

1. Click on the _Add new item_ button. 
2. Start in the _Values_ tab
3. If desired, select a resource template from the top drop-down menu. Resource templates are defined by the site administrators and editors.
4. Select a class from the dropdown (these are populated from the Vocabularies in your installation).
5. Add information to the fields provided.  
You have the choice of three forms of input for fields in your item resources: text, a resource from the installation, or an external link.  
**Text** fields are entered with text, which can include html code.  
**Resources** create an internal link between the resource you are creating and the resource which fills that field. An example of how you might use this function would be to link the person item of a writer as the creator of one of its works.  
**External Links** link to a website or online resource hosted somewhere other than your installation. 
6. Under the _Media_ tab, add media files for the item
7. Under the _Visibility_ tab you can change the settings for whether the item is visible to everyone including the public, on people on your OmekaS install, or just your site.

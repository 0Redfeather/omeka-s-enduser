title: Administrative Dashboard
---

The administrative dashboard manages the content shared by all OmekaS sites and the core functionalities of the OmekaS installation. 

In the upper right hand corner of the window on the admin dashboard and throughout the install is the message “Welcome, *User*” where *User* is the display name of the person logged in. Next to this is the button to *Logout*. 

The following content appears on the left side of the admin dashboard and on all administrative pages.

In the upper left corner of the screen is a link displaying the title of the installation which will always take you back to the admin dashboard. 

Underneath the installation title is a search field which has an option for advanced search (ellipses) in addition to the button to search (magnifying glass). The search function will survey content on the administrative install, including items, vocabularies, resource templates, and media.  

From the left hand navigation of the admin dashboard, Global Administrators can access the following functions:

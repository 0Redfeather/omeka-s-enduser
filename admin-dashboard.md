title: Administrative Dashboard

The administrative dashboard manages the content shared by all OmekaS sites and the core functionalities of the OmekaS installation. 

The following content appears on the left side of the admin dashboard and on all administrative pages.

In the upper left corner of the screen is a link displaying the title of the installation which will always take you back to the admin dashboard. 

Directly below the installation title is the message “Signed in as *User*” where *User* is the display name of the person logged in. Next to this is the button to *Logout*. 

Underneath the user information is a search field which has an option for advanced search (ellipses) in addition to the button to search (magnifying glass). The search function will survey content on the administrative install, including items, vocabularies, resource templates, and media.  

Advanced search options (the ellipses) allow you to refine the search by Resource Type, limiting it to *Items*, *Item Sets*, or *Media* by clicking the radio button next to the Resource Type you want to search.

title: Administrative Dashboard
---

The administrative dashboard manages the content shared by all OmekaS sites as well as managing the core functionalities of the OmekaS installation. 

![View of the left hand navigation on the admin dashboard, which also appears consistently throughout the admin interface, with options as described below](/files/leftnav.png)

The following content appears on the left side of the admin dashboard, both in the main view of the installation (/admin) and throughout the administrative side of the installation. 

In the upper left corner of the screen is a link displaying the name of the installation which will always take you back to the admin dashboard (/admin). 

Underneath the site name is a search field which has an option for advanced search (ellipses) in addition to the button to search (magnifying glass). The search function here covers all content on the administrative install, including items, vocabularies, resource templates, and media.  

From the left hand navigation of the admin dashboard, users can access the following functions:

- [Items](../content/items.md): manage the individual resources of your install. (Box icon)
- *Media*: browse media content related to items. (Photo icon)
- [Item Sets](../content/item-sets.md): manage aggregated groups of items. (Multiple boxes icon)
- [Vocabularies](../content/vocabularies.md): manage the metadata standards for your install. (Closed book icon)
- [Resource Templates](../content/resource-template.md): manage predefined sets of properties (fields) to use when creating items. (Pencil in a square icon)
- [Users](../users.md): manage users for the whole install and individual sites. (Three people icon)
- *Modules*: add functionality to your sites. (Plus sign in square icon)
- *Jobs*: displays the user-activated tasks which are currently running. NB: jobs only display when they are running. (Three bars icon)
- [Sites](../sites/sites.md): lists and provides access to all of the sites on the OmekaS install. (Computer icon)
- *Settings*: manage the global settings for all sites, the admin dashboard and the site dashboards. (Gears icon)


Below the navigation is a small display which tells you which version of Omeka S you are running.

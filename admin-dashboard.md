title: Administrative Dashboard
---

The administrative dashboard manages the content shared by all OmekaS sites as well as managing the core functionalities of the OmekaS installation. 

![Left-hand view on the admin dashboard, which appears consistently throughout the admin interface, with options as described below](../files/admindashleft.png)

The following content appears on the left side of the admin interface, both in the main dashboard (/admin) and throughout the administrative side of the installation. 

In the upper left corner of the screen is a link displaying the name of the installation which will always take you back to the admin dashboard (/admin). 

Underneath the site name is a search field which has an option for advanced search (ellipses) in addition to the button to search (magnifying glass). The search function here covers all content on the administrative install, including items, vocabularies, resource templates, and media.  

From the left hand navigation of the admin dashboard, access the following functions:

- [Items](../content/items.md): manage the individual resources of your install.
- *Media*: browse media content related to Items.
- [Item Sets](../content/item-sets.md): manage aggregated groups of items.
- [Vocabularies](../content/vocabularies.md) manage the metadata standards for your install.
- [Resource Templates](../content/resource-template.md): manage predefined sets of properties (fields) to use when creating items.
- [Users](../users.md): manage users for the whole install and individual sites.
- *Modules* add functionality to your sites
- *Jobs* show you what user-activated tasks are currently running. NB: jobs only display when they are running.
- [Sites](../sites/sites.md) lists and provides access to all of the sites on the OmekaS install
- *Settings* for specifying the global settings for all sites, the admin dashboard and the site dashboards.

The Custom Vocab module allows you to create a controlled vocabulary and add it to a specific property in a resource template. When using that template for an item, the property will load with a dropdown limited to the options of the controlled vocabulary, rather than a text entry box.

Create a Custom Vocab
--------------------
Once you have installed and activated the module, go to the Custom Vocab tab in the left-hand navigation, under the Modules heading. 

Click the Add a New Vocab button in the upper right-hand corner of the window.

Give the vocab a *Label* which you will use to find it when adding to a resource template.

(Optional) Indicate the *language* of the vocab.

In the *terms* field, list the terms for the controlled vocabulary, one term per line. 

Hit submit to save changes.

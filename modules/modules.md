To see what modules are installed on your Omeka S site, click on the Modules link on your administrative dashboard. The name of the module will appear under the Module heading and the Status will either be Active or Not Active.

There are three icons located next to the title of the module. The first icon (description of icon) allows users to activate or deactivate the module. The second icon (an arrow pointing the the right) allows users to install or uninstall the module. The third icon (ellipses) provides details of the module. Another icon (a wrench) allows users to configure the module.

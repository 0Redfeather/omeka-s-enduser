There are search functions on both the administrative and public sides of Omeka S installs and sites. 

Underneath the user information is a search field which has an option for advanced search (ellipses) in addition to the button to search (magnifying glass). The search function will survey content on the administrative install, including items, vocabularies, resource templates, and media.

Advanced search options (the ellipses) allow you to refine the search by Resource Type, limiting it to *Items*, *Item Sets*, or *Media* by clicking the radio button next to the Resource Type you want to search. 

## Advanced Item Search

Advanced search for items only is available on the [Items](/content/items.md) page, from the *Advanced Search* link above the table of items.

The advanced search loads on a new page, and has the following options:

- *Search by Class*: select a class by which to search from the dropdown menu
- *Search by value*: search for a term or phrase which you enter 
    - The first selector allows you to specify a property to search. 
    - The second selector allows you to set the relationship the property has exactly, does not have exactly, contains, or does not contain the value you enter in the text area.
    - finally, there is a text field for you to enter the value you want the property to have.
- *In site pool*: select from a dropdown menu of all the sites on the Omeka S installation, sorted by user-owner. 
- *Search by item set*: select from a dropdown of item sites.

Both *Search by value* and *search by item set* allow you to add multiple inputs - use the *add new value* or *add new item set* buttons to search with more than one value or item set. These search terms build - searching for two item sets will return all items in either item set, rather than only those items which are in both. 

You can remove value and item set searches using the red trash can icon to the right of those search options.

Advanced search for item sets only is available on the [Item Sets](/content/item-sets.md) page, from the *Advanced Search* link above the table of item sets.

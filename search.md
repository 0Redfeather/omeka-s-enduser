There are search functions on both the administrative and public sides of Omeka S installs and sites. 

Underneath the user information is a search field which has an option for advanced search (ellipses) in addition to the button to search (magnifying glass). The search function will survey content on the administrative install, including items, vocabularies, resource templates, and media.

Advanced search options (the ellipses) allow you to refine the search by Resource Type, limiting it to *Items*, *Item Sets*, or *Media* by clicking the radio button next to the Resource Type you want to search. 

Advanced search options are accessible on the *Items* page. Users may use drop down menus to select metadata fields and search by the following:
-Search by class
-Search by value
-Search by property
-Search by item set

There are search functions on both the administrative and public sides of Omeka S installs and sites. 

Underneath the user information is a search field which has an option for advanced search (ellipses) in addition to the button to search (magnifying glass). The search function will survey content on the administrative install, including items, vocabularies, resource templates, and media.

Advanced search options (the ellipses) allow you to refine the search by Resource Type, limiting it to *Items*, *Item Sets*, or *Media* by clicking the radio button next to the Resource Type you want to search. 

Advanced search options are accessible on the *Items* page, from the *Advanced Search* link above the table of items

Users may use drop down menus to select metadata fields and search by the following:
- *Search by class*: search by resource Class. 
- *Search by value*: search for a term or phrase. 
    - The first selector allows you to specify a property to search. 
    - The second selector allows you to set the relationship the property has exactly, does not have exactly, contains, or does not contain the value you enter in the text area.
    - finally, there is a text field for you to enter the value you want the property to have.
- *Search by item set*: include all items within a specific item set. This is the only criteria where adding will actually broaden the pool - selecting a second item set will include all items in Item Set A or in Item Set B.

Admin users may change the settings for the admin dashboard and general settings for sites using the *Settings* tab on the left side of the admin dashboard. 

## Global Settings

*Administrator Email* sets the email address for the installation administrator. 
Note that some hosting setups may require that the domain name for the administrator email match the domain name of the installation (if your domain is yourinstall.org, the administrator email must be user@yourinstall.org).  

*Results per page* changes the number of results (items, item sets, media) displayed per page when browsing in either public or admin sides of the installation.

*Property label information* determines what is displayed next to each property when users are editing items and item sets. 
* By default, this is set to *none*, meaning that only the property label is displayed.
* If *show vocabulary* is selected, the parenthetical statement next to the property name displays the vocabulary used (for example, Dublin Core) 
* If *show term* is selected, the parenthetical statement next to the property name displays the vocabulary:term (for example, dc:title).

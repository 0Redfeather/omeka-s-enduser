title: Site Navigation

Use the *Navigation* tab of the [Sites](../sites/sites.md) to manage the navigation, or menu, or your site. You can add links, browse pages, and your [pages](../sites/site_pages.md) to the navigation, arrange them, and delete links from the navigation.

## Adding Navigation
To add a link you can use the *Add a custom link* drop-down on the right hand drawer to add either:
 - a *Custom URL* to any web address; or
 - a Browse page for items on your site.

Or you can add one of your [pages](../sites/site_pages.md), which should be listed in the right-hand drawer below the *Add a custom link* dropdown. If you need to find a specific page, begin typing the page title in the search box with the helper text *Filter pages* which appears directly below the text “Add a link to a site page.”

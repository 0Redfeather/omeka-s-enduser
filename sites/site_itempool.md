title: Sites Item Pool
---

The Item Pool determines what automatically appears in the resource selection options on the [pages](../sites/site_pages.md) of your Omeka S [site](../sites/sites.md). It also can also be used to limit the resources which appear on a browse page on your site.

![The Item Pool tab on site settings has multiple search options, as described below](../sites/sitesfiles/sites_itempool.png)

Note that the search options for the Item Pool build on each other. Every search you add further narrows what is returned for the pool.

The settings in the Item Pool tab allow you to set the parameters for the pool. You can use one or more of the search options:
* *Search by class*: search by resource Class. 
* *Search all properties*: create a search across all properties in all items. You can use the drop-down menu to select from: has exact value, does not have exact value, contains value, or does not contain value. Use the *Add new value* to create additional search criteria.
* *Search specific property*: search for words or phrases within a specific property. Select the property from the drop down menu, and then select from: as exact value, does not have exact value, contains value, or does not contain value. Use the *Add new value* to create additional search criteria.
* *Search resources*: search for resources which either *has property* or *does not have property* for a specific resource class.
* *Search by item set*: include all items within a specific item set.

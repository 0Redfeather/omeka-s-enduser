title: Site Theme

The Theme tab of the site context menu allows you to select the theme for your site, and to set theme-specific settings. 

## Select a Theme
When you navigate to the Theme tab, the current theme will appear on the top of the page. If you did not select a theme when adding the site, this will be the Default theme. 

A large image of the theme in action appears on the left, with the theme Title, creator, and a button for Theme Settings on the right.

Below the current theme are buttons for all other installed themes. The buttons have a small image of the theme in action, the theme name, and a link to the creator of the theme. 

To switch themes, click on the theme which you want to use. It should highlight slightly in gray, with a checkbox in the lower right-hand corner of the theme button. 

Click the Save button in the upper right-hand corner of the window to save changes.

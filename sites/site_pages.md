Pages form the content of your [sites](../sites/sites.md). A site can have a single page or many pages.

Manage the pages for a site by navigating to the Sites tab on the left-hand navigation of the admin dashboard. Select the site  for which you want to manage the pages and click edit. 

Once you are editing the site, click the Pages tab on the top navigation for sites. 

## Editing Pages  
After clicking the Pages tab, select the page you wish to edit by clicking the name of the page or the edit button (pencil). On the right hand side you can choose to add a new block by selecting one of the following layouts:

*HTML:* Opens up an HTML box in which you can add text and links

*Browse preview:* Allows you to add resources via searching 

*One item:* Once you click the Select Item button, a drawer appears on the right hand side displaying the various items in your Omeka install. Click on the item you wish to add to the page and then click the Select resource button. You can add a caption to the item using the box. In order to add more than one item you will need to continually choose the One item layout until you have populated your page with as many items as you wish.

Once you have added items to your page, click the Save button in the right hand corner. You can delete any of the blocks by clicking on the trash can icon located next to the title of the block. The position of the blocks on the page can be changed by dragging and dropping a specific block.

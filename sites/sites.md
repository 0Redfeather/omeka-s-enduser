Sites are the public-facing side of an Omeka-S installation. With sites you can create content and interpretation around a set of items from your installation. 

Sites are managed and access via the *Sites* tab on the left-hand side of the administrative dashboard.

The manage sites page displays a table with all the sites for the installation, giving the title and owner for each site. Either of these columns can be used to sort the list of sites by using the up and down arrows on the right edge of the column heading.
Each row gives the title of a site, options to *edit* (pencil), *delete* (trash can), or *view details* (ellipses), and the owner of the site. *Only global admins and site owners can delete a site.*

## Adding a site
To create a site, click the *Add new site* button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. 

You will need to:
* create a *slug* for the site’s url. The url will be *installurl/site/slug*
* Give your site a *title*
* Select which *theme* you want for the site or whether to go with the installation default. Themes set the appearance of the site.

## Editing a Site
To edit a site, either click on the *edit* (pencil) icon for the site on the manage sites page or click on the site’s name in that same page.

On the *Admin* tab on the edit site page, you can change the site’s *URL Slug*, *Title*, and *Theme*

On the *Pages* tab you can add, edit, and delete [pages](../sites/pages.md) for the site.

On the *User permissions* tab you can manage which users can access the administrative side of the site. 

## Managing Site Users
To add a user to a site, navigate to the *User permissions* tab (see above).

On the right hand side of the screen a drawer will appear that shows all of the users for your install. The users will be sorted by the letter of their first name. To add a user, click on their name. You will then be prompted to check various boxes:

Admin: Gives user full administrative privileges  
Attach: Not sure?   
Edit: Gives user editing privileges

Once you've selected the box(es) for the user you wish to add, click the Save button located in the upper right hand corner. You can add or revoke privileges for users by going back to the User permissions tab and selecting or deselecting the boxes and clicking Save. Users can be deleted from the site by clicking the trash can icon located next to the Edit box.

Editing a Page within a Site  
After clicking the Pages tab, select the page you wish to edit by clicking the name of the page or the edit button (pencil). On the right hand side you can choose to add a new block by selecting one of the following layouts:

HTML: Opens up an HTML box in which you can add text and links
Browse preview: Allows you to add resources via searching 
One item: Once you click the Select Item button, a drawer appears on the right hand side displaying the various items in your Omeka install. Click on the item you wish to add to the page and then click the Select resource button. You can add a caption to the item using the box. In order to add more than one item you will need to continually choose the One item layout until you have populated your page with as many items as you wish.

Once you have added items to your page, click the Save button in the right hand corner. You can delete any of the blocks by clicking on the trash can icon located next to the title of the block. The position of the blocks on the page can be changed by dragging and dropping a specific block.

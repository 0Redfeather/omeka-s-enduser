Sites are the public-facing side of an Omeka-S installation. With sites you can create content and interpretation around a set of items from your installation. 

Sites are managed and access via the *Sites* tab on the left-hand side of the administrative dashboard. 

The manage sites page displays a table with all the sites for the installation, giving the title and owner for each site. Either of these columns can be used to sort the list of sites by using the up and down arrows on the right edge of the column heading.
Each row gives the title of a site, options to *edit* (pencil), *delete* (trash can), or *view details* (ellipses), and the owner of the site. *Only global admins and site owners can delete a site.*

## Adding a site
To create a site, click the *Add new site* button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. 

You will need to:
* create a *slug* for the site’s url. The url will be *installurl/site/slug*
* Give your site a *title*
* Select which *theme* you want for the site or whether to go with the installation default. Themes set the appearance of the site.

## Editing a Site
To edit a site, either click on the *edit* (pencil) icon for the site on the manage sites page or click on the site’s name in that same page.

On the *Admin* tab on the edit site page, you can change the site’s *URL Slug*, *Title*, and *Theme*

On the *Pages* tab you can add, edit, and delete pages for the site.

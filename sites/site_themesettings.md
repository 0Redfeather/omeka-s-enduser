title: Site Theme Settings
date: 25 October 2016
---

The theme for the site is selected in the [site info](../sites/sites.md#site-info) tab of your site. This tab allows you to customize theme settings for the site.

Depending on which theme you have selected, you may see any of the following setting options:

Top Navigation Depth
-------------------------------
(Default, Cozy)

Top Navigation Depth allows you the limit the depth of the top navigation menu on the public side of the site.  The default setting, 0, does not restrict the number of levels of the top navigation menu. Setting it to one would only show the top-level pages or links of your site.

Logo
---------------------------------
(Default, Center Row, The Daily, Cozy)

Upload a asset (file) to function as a logo in the header of your site. 

This asset is not associated with any of the items, and will be stored separately; once uploaded to a site you will be able to select it again without re-uploading even if you change themes for a while. Any asset uploaded to one site will be available for all sites on the installation/.

![Logo option](../sites/sitesfiles/sitetheme_logo.png)

To upload a logo, click the Select button. This will open a sidebar where you can either upload a new file from your computer or choose from assets already uploaded to the installation.

Note that the logo completely replaces the header, including the site title, for the site, so you may want to consider an image with text if it is important to you that users see the site title.

To remove a logo, click the *clear* button in that block (only visible when a logo is active) and save changes.

Footer Content
--------------------------
(all themes)

A text field in which you can enter content to appear in the footer of the site.

By default the message is Powered by Omeka S. 

You can add HTML formatting to the text by manually adding the tags. 

Color Selection
-------------------
The theme Cozy includes the option to enter values for colors for the *main accent color* and *navigation background color*

![color option fields](../sites/sitesfiles/sitetheme_color.png)

The Main Accent color is used for link text and on-hover colors, as in the image below:

The navigation background color sets the color of the navigation sidebar for the theme.

Edit either field by typing a [color value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors) into the field. Either a triplet or a six-character hexadecimal code will work. Once you have entered a valid value, the color bar on the left will automatically update to show the color entered, even without saving changes.

The default values are stored in the prompt text for the field. For the Cozy theme, the default values are: main accent color is `089494` and navigation background color is `bfdcdc`

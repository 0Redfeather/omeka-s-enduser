title: Omeka S
---

Omeka S is the newest Omeka platform and offers the ability to create multiple sites from a single install, with shared resources. It has a completely different code base than Omeka Classic but the same commitment to open source web publishing. 

Features of Omeka S include:
- the ability to administer many sites from a single installation;
- a fully functioning Read/Write REST API, which the system uses to execute most of its own core operations;
- the use of JSON-LD as the native data format, which enmeshes the materials in the LOD universe;
- native RDF vocabularies (DCMI Terms, DCMI Types, FOAF, BIBO);
- and a set of modules to aid integration with Fedora, DSpace, Zotero. 

**Why would I use Omeka S?**
A number of institutions host multiple Omeka sites off a single server, or even have one very large Omeka site with multiple exhibits, each with its own theme and topic. Omeka S is the perfect solution for these institutions. With S, there is a single instance of Omeka for updating the core, adding plugins, and otherwise conducting maintenance, while at the same time each site remains distinct from the other sites. 

Another reason to use Omeka S is to take advantage of the linked open data model, which allows rich connections between items in your installation.

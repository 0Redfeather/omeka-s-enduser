Basic instructions for installing from GitHub can be found in the [https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s/blob/develop/README.md](ReadMe) of the Omeka S github repository.

If you are installing from the released zip file, you can use the instructions on the ReadMe or follow these instructions for [http://bavatuesdays.com/installing-omeka-s-alpha-on-reclaim-hosting-via-command-line/](Installing Omeka S Alpha on Reclaim Hosting via Command Line), by Jim Groom. 

Once you have successfully installed and configured the database.ini file, you can navigate to the location of your Omeka S install.

The first time you to the install site, you will need to enter information for the first user, along with basic information for your install.

# End User Documentation for Omeka S

Omeka S is a web publication system for universities, galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. It creates a local network of independently curated exhibits sharing a collaboratively built pool of items and their metadata. Watch our [screencast for a quick tour of Omeka S](https://vimeo.com/188656162)

Omeka S is developed alongside [Omeka Classic](http://www.omeka.org), part of the Omeka family of web publishing platforms.

# Omeka S User Manual

Omeka S is a web publication system for universities, galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. It creates a local network of independently curated exhibits sharing a collaboratively built pool of items and their metadata. Watch our [screencast for a quick tour of Omeka S](https://vimeo.com/241702586)

Omeka S is developed alongside [Omeka Classic](http://www.omeka.org), part of the Omeka family of web publishing platforms.

## Try it out
The Omeka S Sandbox is a place to get a feel for the system works without going to the process of an installation. The Sandbox has been pre-populated with resources, sites, and module settings; the installation resets to just this initial content on a regular basis.

In Omeka S, you will build sites from scratch after creating a body of resources (items, item sets) with which to populate your site. However, you may want to start thinking about the structure of your site even before you begin creating resources.

Before you start building out a site in Omeka S, it is useful to sketch out an outline or simple [wireframes] to help plan the arrangement of content and to determine how you want your audiences to access and use that content in the website.

Planning for the content first will help you think about the ways that Omeka can work best for you throughout different stages of the project. 

## Questions to ask while planning a site
These questions will help with those planning steps.

**What are the primary goals of the site?**

**Who is the primary audience of this site?** Being specific will help you shape the site; "people interested in historic architecture" is much more useful than "the general public." Do you have secondary audiences? What do you want these specific audiences to accomplish when they come to the site?

**What sections will this site include**? 
On creation, an Omeka S site will include navigation options for:
- Custom URL
- Browse
- Browse item sets
- Welcome (a page with a single HMTL block)

You do not have to use any of these pages or links. How do you want to structure your site? What are the main sections (parent pages) and subsections (child pages)?

Something about BLOCKS goes here (
And about PAGES 


**What will I do with resources in this website?**
Items are the building blocks of Omeka S. What sort of [resource templates] will you want to create and use to fully describe your items? Any item you include on an Omeka S will have a public item show page, so try to ensure that the information in an [item's] metadata can stand on its own. 

- Determine the types of items/sources/objects you plan to use in this site, for example videos, documents, images, audio files.
- What sort of [resource templates] will you want to create and use to fully describe your items?
- Do you need additional [vocabularies] to describe your items?

ITEM SETS

Using your own resources

Think about how you might structure the metadata for your resources, both in terms of resource templates but also modules, for example:

- Do you want to use subject headings or descriptive categories from an existing schema? Try the [ValueSuggest](modules/valuesuggest/)module.
- Would you like to establish your own Controlled Vocabulary for specific metadata fields, to make it easier for you team to enter consistent data? Use the [Custom Vocab](modules/customvocab/) module.
- Do you want to display items on a map, or associate an item with multiple locations? Use the [Mapping] module.

Think about how you want to display items, and how you want user to interact with resources and the site:

- Do you want to display items on a map, or associate an item with multiple locations? Use the [Mapping] module.
- Are you interested in collecting materials from your visitors through a web form, such as a story or textual reflection, photos, videos, et al. Install the [Collecting] module.
- Do you want users to be able to share items from your site on social media? Try the Sharing module. 

## Try Omeka S before installing
Experiment with Omeka S on the [sandbox](https://omeka.org/s/download/#sandbox), an installation pre-populated with items, item sets, resource templates, and a few sites. Sandbox content is reset every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday.

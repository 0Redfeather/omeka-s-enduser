Title: Media
---
Media are only created by adding them to an Item. Media cannot exist independently. 

To view the media associated with an item, click on the mediaâ€™s name in the right-hand sidebar on the item view page.

To view all media in the installation, first go to the admin item browse. In the left hand navigation, an option for Media browse will appear under the Item browse (you may have to click on the triangle to expand the menu below Items)

## Add Media

Adding media includes uploading a file, or directly attaching content with oEmbed, YouTube URLs, or writing HTML.

Media can only be added via the [item](../content/items.md). 

## Edit Media
To edit an existing media, go to its metadata page and select the *Edit media* button in the upper right corner of the page. 

If desired, you can select a *Resource Template* or *Class* from the two dropdown menus which load automatically. Selecting a resource template will populate the page with predetermined properties.

You can also add properties by selecting from the list on the right side of the screen. You can either browse fields by vocabulary (Dublin Core, Bibliographic Ontology, etc), or search in the *filter properties* bar above the list of properties and vocabularies.

Automatically generated metadata, such as source, visibility, and part of item, cannot be edited. 

Use the *make public/private* button (eye icon) to set whether the media is visible to the public or only to users of the OmekaS install.

![make private button showing an eye icon with a diagonal slash through it](../content/contentfiles/item_private.png)  Private

Note that if an item is private, all the media attached is private, but an item which is public can have attached media which are set to be either public or private.

There are search functions on both the administrative and public sides of Omeka S installs and sites. 

## Administrative interface

### Basic search

There is a search field near the top of the left-hand menu, just underneath the user information. This search field works as a keyword search across all the properties for a resource.

By default, this search operates on items in your installation. However, you can use the ellipses (three dots) to open a menu and change the resource type being searched, selecting from Items, Item Sets, or Media.

### Item Advanced Search

Advanced search for items only is available on the [Items](/content/items.md) page, from the *Advanced Search* link above the table of items.

![Advanced search button indicated with a red arrow.](/files/advancedsearch2.png)

The advanced search loads on a new page, and has the following options:

*Search full-text:* runs a full-text search on all of the text for every item in the installation.

*Search by value:* search for a term or phrase which you enter 

- The first selector allows you to specify a property to search. 
- The second selector allows you to set the relationship the property has with the value. The options are:
	- is exactly, 
	- is not exactly, 
	- contains,
	- does not contain,
	- is resource with ID,
	- is not resource with ID,
	- has any value (there is something in the property), and
	- has no values.
- Finally, there is a text field for you to enter the value you want the property to have.

To find a resource ID, go to the resource and look at the url in your browser's address bar. The numbers at the end of the url are the resource ID. 

*Search by class:* select a class by which to search from the dropdown menu

*Search by template:* select a resource template from the dropdown. Templates are arranged by owner, then alphabetically. 

*Search by item set:* select from a dropdown of item sites.

*In site pool:* select from a dropdown menu of all the sites on the Omeka S installation, sorted by user-owner.

Searches by value, class, template, and item set allow you to search by more than one input - use the *add new* buttons to search with more than one value or item set. These search terms build - searching for two item sets will return all items in either item set, rather than only those items which are in both. 

You can remove value and item set searches using the red trash can icon to the right of those search options.

You can reset your search terms at any time by using the "Reset" button on the upper right next to the "Search" button.

## Media Advanced Search
Advanced search for media is accessed from the [Media](content/media) browse page, from the *Advanced Search* link above the table of item sets.

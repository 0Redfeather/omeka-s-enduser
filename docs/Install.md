Basic instructions for installing from GitHub or the downloaded file can be found in the [ReadMe](https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s/blob/develop/README.md) of the Omeka S github repository.

Once you have successfully installed and configured the database.ini file, you can navigate to the location of your Omeka S install.

The first time you to the install site, you will need to enter information for the first user, along with basic information for your install. There are two sections on this page: *Create the first user* and *Settings*. 

In the First User section, enter:

- an *email* address, and type again to confirm.*
- confirm the *password* and type again in the next input to confirm.
- a *display name* for the user

Note that you can change all of these later in the [User](/admin/users.md) management section of your install.

- The installation's *time zone* (select from dropdown), and
- select a *locale* for the language of the admin side of the installation.

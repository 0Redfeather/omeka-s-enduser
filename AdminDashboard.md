The administrative dashboard manages the content shared by all OmekaS sites as well as managing the core functionalities of the OmekaS installation. 

On the left side of the admin dashboard, there is a link displaying the name of the installation which will always take you back to the admin dashboard (/admin). 

Underneath the site name is a search field which has an option for advanced search (ellipses) in addition to the button to search (magnifying glass). The search function here covers all content on the administrative install, including items, vocabularies, resource templates, and media.  

From the left hand navigation of the admin dashboard, access the following functions:
- [Items](/content/Items.md): individual resource assets shared between all sites based in this OmekaS install.
- *Media*
- *Item Sets*
- *Vocabularies*
- [Resource Templates](content/ResourceTemplate.md): a way of creating predefined sets of properties (fields) to use when creating items.
- [Users](/Users.md): manage users for the whole install and individual sites.
- *Modules* add functionality to your sites
- *Jobs* show you what user-activated tasks are currently running.
- *Sites* lists and provides access to all of the sites on the OmekaS install

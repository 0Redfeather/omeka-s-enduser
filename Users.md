There are six user roles in OmekaS.
- Global Admin: full site privileges
- Site Administrator: Full site privileges except: modules: browse only; vocabularies: search, read, create.
- Editor (Content Expert): full privileges for content creation, editing, and deleting; limited privileges for user, module, and vocabularies.
- Reviewer: robust content privileges but can only delete own content.
- Author: Create own content.
- Researcher: Search and read privileges only.

Only site and global administrators can create, edit, and delete users. Editors, Reviewers, Authors, and Researchers can edit their own user information but cannot change the information of other users. 

Administrators manage and create users from the User section of the main administrative dashboard. This page displays the user’s username followed by full name in parentheses, as well as their role and the date the account was created.

## Create a New User
To create a new user, select the *Add new user* button in the upper right hand corner of the Users section in the main administrative dashboard. 

On the Add User page, enter the following:
- Username
- Name (full name or credit name)
- Email address
- and select a Role using the dropdown menu (see above for user role privileges)

## Managing Users
To manage an existing user, go to the Users section.

To view the name, email, and role of a user, click on the username. To quickly view this information without leaving the page, click on the … button to the left of the role. 

To edit a user’s information, change their password, or access API keys, click the edit icon (pencil) to the left of their role. The Edit User page has three tabs: one for information, one for the password, and one for API keys. 

## Delete a User
On the User page of the administrative dashboard, click the trash can icon in the user’s row, to the left of their role information, to delete the user. Confirm the deletion in the dialog box which will appear on the right of the screen.
